Lockdown hasn't gone away and so we have new ways to teach, virtual coffee breaks with colleagues, and remote conferences and seminars.
To get to know our  [Numerical Analysis Seminar guests](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tu-delft-institute-for-computational-science-and-engineering/events/dcse-conferences/numerical-analysis-seminars/) a bit better, we have started an informal interview series called [In Conversation With](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tu-delft-institute-for-computational-science-and-engineering/events/in-conversation-with).
<!--more-->In the run-up to each seminar, Marieke Kootte sits down with our guests for a personal conversation on their backgrounds, the inevitable ups and downs in life and academia, and lessons/advice for students and young researchers.
Check out the interviews from the first semester [here](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tu-delft-institute-for-computational-science-and-engineering/events/in-conversation-with)!

PS: Love what [Xavier Claeys said here](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tu-delft-institute-for-computational-science-and-engineering/events/in-conversation-with/xavier-claeys) - "There is another important aspect of this job that is at least as difficult as answering questions: asking questions."
