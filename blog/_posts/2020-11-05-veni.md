title: 'NWO Veni Grant'
---

I heard today that my proposal for the [NWO Veni](https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme-veni-science-domain) has been funded! Now looking forward to the research project which is going to be focused on the mathematical theory of splines and their use in simulations.
NWO's official announcement can be [found here](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/161-researchers-awarded-nwo-veni-grant-worth-250000-euros).
