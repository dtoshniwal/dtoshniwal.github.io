title: 'Short course on Structure-preserving methods'
---

Just finished teaching a short course on "Structure-preserving methods: Finite element exterior calculus and Isogeometric Extensions in isogeometric extensions" with Espen Sande. The course was organized for the PhD students at University of Rome Tor Vergata and upon invitation by Carla Manni and Hendrik Speleers. The topic itself is very interesting (a framework for building and analyzing stable and accurate spline-based finite element methods for a wide variety of PDEs) and I had fun teaching it, would definitely like to repeat it sometime in the future!
