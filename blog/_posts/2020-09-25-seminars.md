title: 'Seminars ahoy!'
---

During my time at UT Austin, I really enjoyed the frequent seminars given by excellent researchers from within UT Austin as well as from all over the world.
This is one aspect that I have wanted to replicate for sometime at Delft.
Finally, after postponements due to Covid, me and my co-organizors Kristof Cools and Marieke Kootte, were able to kickoff our own [numerical analysis-focused seminar series](https://www.tudelft.nl/cse/events/dcse-conferences/numerical-analysis-seminars/) today and I am quite excited about the whole affair!
Our first speaker was Carolina Urzua-Torres who spoke on analysis of a space-time boundary element formulation for the wave equation.
We have a great list of speakers booked for Q1 and Q2 with more to come, and Marieke is working on a soon-to-be-announced accompaniement to the series that I am *really* looking forward to.
