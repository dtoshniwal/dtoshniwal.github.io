title: 'CWI Research Semester Program on Magnetohydrodynamics'
---

Our proposal for organizing a research semester program at CWI on the topic of "Magnetohydrodynamics: From physical models to simulation tools" has been accepted! We (Artur Palha, Silke Glas, Guido Huijsmans, Tomasz Tyranowski, Benjamin Sanderse, Dimitris Loukrezis and Jannis Tenuissen) will be organizing a workshop, a summer school and a few seminars on this topic in Autumn 2027. More information to come.
