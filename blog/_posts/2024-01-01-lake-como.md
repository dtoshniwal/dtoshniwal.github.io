---

I'm a part of the summer school on IGA that is being organized at the [Lake Como School of Advanced Studies](https://lakecomoschool.org/2024schools/) by Giancarlo Sangalli, Carlotta Giannelli and Monica Montardini! I will be lecturing alongside Carlotta Giannelli, Tom Hughes, Monica Montardini, Ale Reali, Giancarlo Sangalli and Hendrik Speleers -- very excited!
