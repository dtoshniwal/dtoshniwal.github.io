title: 'NDNS+ Special Activity Group: Structure-preserving numerical methods'
---

Together with Artur Palha, Jason Frank, Benjamin Sanderse, Matthias Schlottbom, Tomasz Tyranowski and Roel Verstappen, we have set up an NDNS+ Special Activity Group on the theme of "Structure-preserving numerical methods." Over the course of the next couple of years, we will be organizing meetings and workshops, with the aim of formally establishing a coherent Dutch community on the topic by bringing together people who are working in this area. If you are interested in joining, get in touch!
